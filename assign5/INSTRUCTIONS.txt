Computational Methods Assignment 5 Folder - ODE Integration

Contents:

intmain.cpp    - Program which answers question 1 by solving the given coupled
	      	 ODE's using the Runge-Kutta '45' class.
erfmain.cpp    - Program corresponding to question 2 which compares the number of
		 function evaluations of both the RK45 method and the collapsed 
		 adaptive Simpson's rule to evaluated the error function (which
		 is included in this file) at x = 2.
specifics.cpp  - Contains the multivariate vector function which represents the
	         set of coupled ODE's specified in question 1.
specifics.h    - Header for the mulitvariate vector function in question 1.
rk4.h          - Header file containing the declaration of the Rungekutta4 class
		 and associated member functions used for all calculations
rk4.cpp	       - Contains the non-trivial class member functions for the 
		 "Rungekutta4" class
Makefile       - Compiles the intmain.cpp and erfmain.cpp programs
report5.pdf    - Report describing methods and discussing displayed results
intgraph.p     - Contains instructions for gnuplot to view the raw data


Instructions for assign5 folder for Computational Methods (TSM CDT):

COMPILING:
Using the Makefile provided, type 'make' into the terminal. This will compile
two files 'intmain.cpp' and 'erfmain.cpp', providing executables 'intmain.x' and
'erfmain.x'. To run these, enter './intmain.x' into the terminal, followed by 
'./erfmain.x' and the results used in this assignment's report will be outputted.
Additionally, '.dat' files will be produced containing the data of question 1.

VIEWING GRAPH:
To plot the raw data in gnuplot (assuming gnuplot is installed), type 'gnuplot intgraph.p'
into the terminal to display both graphs in this assignment. This will also produce individual '.png'
files for each.
