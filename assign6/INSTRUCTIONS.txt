Computational Methods Assignment 6 Folder - Monte Carlo Integration

Contents:

erfrand.cpp    - Program which answers question 2 by estimating the error function
	         evaluated at 2 using several methods of MC integration.
multifunc.cpp  - Program corresponding to question 2 which contains the integrand,
		 the probability distributions, and the inverse cummulative distributions
		 for the program erfrand.cpp to work.
multifunc.h    - Header file for the function used to answer question 2.
rand.h         - Random number generator from assignment 3 for uniform deviate generation
mcint.h        - Class declaration of the Mcint class used to perform the MC integration
		 in question 2 and produce data to be plotted for the report. Also contains
		 declarations of the member functions
mcint.cpp      - Contains the definitions of the member functions for the Mcint class
Makefile       - Compiles the erfrand.cpp program
report6.pdf    - Report describing methods and discussing displayed results
converge.p     - Contains instructions for gnuplot to view the convergence of data with 
		 sample size


Instructions for assign6 folder for Computational Methods (TSM CDT):

COMPILING:
Using the Makefile provided, type 'make' into the terminal. This will compile
'erfrand.cpp', 'multifunc.cpp' and 'mcint.cpp' providing executables 'erfrand.x'. 
To run these, enter './erfrand.x' into the terminal, and the results used in this
assignment's report will be outputted. Additionally, '.dat' files will be produced 
containing the convergence data of from each MC iteration.

VIEWING GRAPH:
To plot the raw data in gnuplot (assuming gnuplot is installed), type 'gnuplot converge.p'
into the terminal to display both graphs in this assignment. This will also produce individual '.png'
files for each.
