Computational Methods Advanced Topics: Fast Fourier Transforms

So the many data files plotted do not clog the directory, please enter the following into
the terminal to create the directories for data and image storing

'mkdir Data images gratimag gratspace gratmom' 

Contents list (after directory creation):

fft_gen.cpp 	- Class member functions of the FFT class used to transform.
fft_gen.h 	- Class declaration for the FFT class.
motion.cpp      - Program to simulate the motion of a Gaussian wavepacket.
fourtet.cpp	- Program to produce the FFT for several different functions.
doubslit.cpp  	- Program to produce images for an animation of the double slit
		  with increasing separation
func_zoo.cpp	- Contains functions for applying the FFT and plotting in fourtet.cpp
func_zoo.h 	- Header file for the functions for FFT in fourtet.cpp
Makefile	- Compiles the .cpp programs
plotter.p	- Plots the wavepacket motion using gnuplot
grateplot.p	- Plots the image for animation of the double slit separation
fourplot.p 	- Plots the FFTs of the functions outputted from the fourtet.cpp program
vidgrate.sh	- Uses ffmpeg to create a video of the images produced from doubslit.cpp
vidme.sh	- Uses ffmpeg to create a video of the wavepacket motion in motion.cpp
Data		- Empty directory within which wavepacket data files are stored
images		- Empty directory within which wavepacket images are stored
gratimag	- Empty directoty within which double slit images are stored
gratmom		- Empty directory within which double slit momentum data is stored
gratspace	- Empty directory within which double slit space data is stored
doubslit.mp4	- Previously made video in case the ffmpeg was not installed
wavemotion.mp4	- Previously made video in cast the ffmpeg was not installed

Instructions for use:

Compilation:
- Enter 'make' into the terminal to compile the .cpp files to obtain three executables

Gaussian wavepacket:
- Enter './motion.x' to output data of the wavepacket motion to a data file
- Enter 'gnuplot plotter.p' to convert this data into a series of timestep images
- Enter './vidme.sh' to convert this set of images into a video
Note: ffmpeg must be installed and permissions of the video creation exe.
To do this, enter:
-> sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

Double Slit:
- Enter './doubslit.x' to output data of double slit with increasing slit separation into data files
- Enter 'gnuplot grateplot.p' to convert this data into images
- Enter './vidgrate.sh' to convert this set of images into a video

Single Fourier Transform Images:
- Enter './fourtet.x' to output data of the space and frequency domains into separate files for each function
- Enter 'gnuplot fourplot.p' to convert these data files for each plot into four separate images that
  display both frequency and space domains.
