Instructions for assign2 folder for Computational Methods (TSM CDT):

COMPILING:
Using the Makefile provided, type 'make' into the terminal. This will compile
the file 'interp.cpp' and provide an executable 'interp.x'. To run this, enter
'./interp.x' into the terminal, and the results of the program will be outputted.

VIEWING GRAPH:
This will create several data files containing tabulated interpolated (x, y) points.
To plot these in gnuplot (assuming gnuplot is installed), type 'gnuplot results.p' 
into the terminal to display the graph for the interpolation methods.

GRAPH VIEWER:
Drag over area to zoom in, and press 'p' to return to previous zoom settings.
