Computational Methods Assignment 3 Folder - Random Numbers


Contents:

rand.h        - Contains random number generator used throughout
uniform.cpp   - File for Question 1 (uniform deviate)
transform.cpp - File for Question 2 (transformation method)
reject.cpp    - File for Question 3 (rejection method)
compare.cpp   - File containing functions necessary for rejection method
compare.h     - Header file used in the rejection method program
Makefile      - Compiles all three main programs (for each question)
histograms.p  - Plots in terminal and outputs .png files of histograms.
report3.pdf   - Report describing and discussing results and justification of methods


Instructions for assign3 folder for Computational Methods (TSM CDT):

COMPILING:
Using the Makefile provided, type 'make' into the terminal. This will compile
three files 'uniform.cpp', 'transform.cpp', and 'reject.cpp', providing executables
'uniform.x', 'transform.x', and 'reject.x'. To run this, enter

'./uniform.x ; ./transform.x ; ./reject.x'

into the terminal, and the results of the time measurements for transformation
and rejection methods will be outputted. Additionally three data files will be
produced with the random variables for each run.

VIEWING GRAPH:
To plot the raw data in gnuplot (assuming gnuplot is installed) as a histogram, type 'gnuplot histograms.p' 
into the terminal to display the histograms for all three programs. This will also produce individual '.png'
files displaying the histograms.

GRAPH VIEWER:
Drag over area to zoom in, and press 'p' to return to previous zoom settings.
