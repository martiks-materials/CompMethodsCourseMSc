Computational Methods Assignment 4 Folder - Numerical Integration

Contents:

numint.cpp    - Program calling ths necessary function and results, specifying parameters
	        and function necessary to answer the questions in assignment 4
integrate.h   - Contains the class which taks the function, limits, and precision and 
	        evaluates the associated integral using either the trapezoid rule or 
		Simpson's rule and returns the value, and the number of function evaluations
integrate.cpp - Contains the non-trivial class member functions for the "Integrate" class
Makefile      - Compiles the numint.cpp and integrate.cpp programs
report4.pdf   - Report describing and discussing results and justification of methods


Instructions for assign4 folder for Computational Methods (TSM CDT):

COMPILING:
Using the Makefile provided, type 'make' into the terminal. This will compile
two files 'numint.cpp' and 'integrate.cpp', providing executable 'numint.x'. To run this, enter
'./numint.x' into the terminal, and the results of the integrals and number of
function evaluations will be outputted into the terminal.
