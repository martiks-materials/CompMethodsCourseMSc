Computational Methods Assignment 8 Folder - Root Finding

Contents:

splisect.cpp      - Program which finds the two roots of the interpolator function using
		    both Brent's method and the bisection method to compare the two methods. 
splining.cpp      - Contains the cubic spline interpolator of the data in Assignment 3
rootmethods.cpp   - Contains the Member functions of the Bisector and BrentMethod classes
		    which perform the root finding algorithms.
splining.h        - Header file for the cubic spline interpolator related functions.
rootmethods.h     - Class declaration of the Bisector and BrentMethod classes which are
		    used to find the root of the interpolating function.
Makefile          - Compiles the splisect.cpp program.
report8.pdf       - Report describing theory and addressing the questions in Assignment 8.
 

Instructions for assign8 folder for Computational Methods (TSM CDT):

COMPILING:
Using the Makefile provided, type 'make' into the terminal. This will compile
'splisect.cpp', 'splining.cpp', and 'rootmethods.cpp', providing executable
'splisect.x'. To run this, enter './splisect.x' into the terminal, and the results 
used in report8.pdf will be outputted.
