Instructions for assign9 folder for Computational Methods (TSM CDT):

COMPILING:
Using the Makefile provided, enter 'make' into the terminal.
To use the executable, enter './sniper.x' into the terminal.
This will produce the data files.

PLOTTING:
To view graphs, enter 'gnuplot intgraph.p' into the terminal.
This will produce .png files.
